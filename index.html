            <h2 class= "overview"> Overview </h2>
            <p>We were a team of 3 working on a mobile application prototype for our UX/UI group project.  This was a two-week sprint group project.  My role in the project was as a UX/UI researcher and designer.  
              <p></p>Our task was to research, prototype, test, and validate an idea for a new mobile application that could solve a real, problem or need in users’ everyday lives..</p>
              <p>I contributed to the project by completing an important task within the design process and provided support to the team in areas of need.  My contributions expanded to conducting interviews, and distributing a wellness survey to users that would provide us an outlook on our target audience and their needs. I then assisted the team with the ideation and design process of our mobile prototype by creating several types of wireframes (low, mid, & high).  Usability testing was completed by each team member to continue modifying and improving our final product.  </p> 
              <p> In the end, we presented a high-fidelity clickable prototype to our peers called Gooday, designed to promote holistic treatment to the mind, body, and spirit.</p>

                  <p class="card-text"> As a team, we brainstormed several case scenarios from first-hand experiences or problems faced within our society. After brainstorming with the team, we determined on the topic of health and wellness was a major concern and needed to be addressed within our society. We focused our target audience on working women with and/or without a family based on our current status as working women with and without a family. We determined our problem after conducting several interviews and receiving feedback from our survey was working women with families or careers are generally feeling under pressure and that we might be able to help or support them if we create an app that promotes and reminds people to engage in self-care activities. In particular, getting outside more and looking after all three aspects of our overall well-being, the mind, body, and spirit.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">User Persona</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> After meeting with the team, I moved on to creating a proto-persona, or a hypothesis of who our target audience could be, what their goals, needs, challenges, and aspirations were. A description of our proto-persona is provided by the name of Sylvia.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Now, to test our hypothesis, I undertook five semi-structured qualitative, one-on-one interviews and also posted a fifteen-question well-being survey through our social media channels.</p>
          <p>I discovered that most people see value in undertaking self-care activities and that everybody partakes in some sort of self-care activity at least once per week but that they are not doing nearly as much as they would like to.</p>

          <p class="card-text">After evaluating our data from our research, we believed in creating a user journey map that outlined four distinct points within the gooday experience for users like Sylvia (Persona) and to think more about her feelings, goals, and opportunities during each of these touchpoints. This helped us better understand our user’s expectations and their expectations when using the app. </p>

 <h3 class= "overview"> The Iteration Process </h3>
  <p>After designing the user flows and stories, I conducted a brainstorming session with the team and provided several features and ideas to tackle the problem we identified based on feedback from stakeholders and the research data from the interviews, surveys, and competitive analysis.  </p>

            <p class="card-text"> After designing a clickable prototype in InVision we decided as a team to put it to the test. I was able to conduct user tests with at least 7 volunteers.  Some of the good feedback was that people found the app to be intuitive, especially in regard to our testing plan which was looking at the onboarding and the selecting of a particular activity.</p>

 <h5>Lesson Learned</h5>
  Working as a team, I learned that different stakeholders’ inputs are very essential to the decision-making process through each design stage. I also believe communication, feedback, and continuous user testing is important to understand our client’s needs and design a product that will solve their problem; however, continuing to improve the product to best meet our client’s goals.</p>
