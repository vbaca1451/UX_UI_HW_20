            <h2 class= "overview"> Overview </h2>
            <p>We were a team of 3 working on a mobile application prototype for our UX/UI group project.  This was a two-week sprint group project.  My role in the project was as a UX/UI researcher and designer.  
              <p></p>Our task was to research, prototype, test, and validate an idea for a new mobile application that could solve a real, problem or need in users’ everyday lives..</p>
              <p>I contributed to the project by completing an important task within the design process and provided support to the team in areas of need.  My contributions expanded to conducting interviews, and distributing a wellness survey to users that would provide us an outlook on our target audience and their needs. I then assisted the team with the ideation and design process of our mobile prototype by creating several types of wireframes (low, mid, & high).  Usability testing was completed by each team member to continue modifying and improving our final product.  </p> 
              <p> In the end, we presented a high-fidelity clickable prototype to our peers called Gooday, designed to promote holistic treatment to the mind, body, and spirit.</p>

                <p> The research process includes our user persona developed through our data reserved from our survey and interviews. To test our hypothesis, I undertook five semi-structured qualitative, one-on-one interviews and also posted a fifteen-question well-being survey through our social media channels.</p>

A description of our proto-persona is provided by the name of Sylvia.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">I also created a 15-question survey using Google Forms and had 27 respondents in three days. I discovered that most people see value in undertaking self-care activities and that everybody partakes in some sort of self-care activity at least once per week but that they are not doing nearly as much as they would like to. The main blockers which came out were lack of time, money, available options, and motivation for most people.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">During the 5 qualitative, semi-structured interviews, the main trends were that people had a good idea as to what self-care meant to them; which related to physical and mental health. There were concerns that they struggled to find the money, motivation, and inspiration to do more than they were already doing. A bit of a surprising insight was that almost all people interviewed said that they felt getting outdoors for some form of exercise was incredibly beneficial for them..</p>

                          <p class="card-text">After evaluating our data from our research, we believed in creating a user journey map that outlined four distinct points within the gooday experience for users like Sylvia (Persona) and to think more about her feelings, goals, and opportunities during each of these touchpoints. This helped us better understand our user’s expectations and their expectations when using the app.</p>
